<milestone unit="absent" />

<p>At the office of Highway Superintendent Ray C. Gill Wednesday, enlistments in the Civilian Conservation Corps was held and nearly fifty young men between the ages of 18 and 25, living in the county enlisted. The specifications governing the enlistments are:</p>

<p>Applications at present are being accepted only from unmarried men between the ages of 18 and 25. There are no restrictions as to color or creed, but you must be an American citizen or have made application for citizenship.</p>

<p>In South Dakota your application will be taken by the county relief director, or if there is none in your county, by the county auditor. After filling out the application you wait until you are called. When the call comes you will be notified and report to the nearest army recruiting station, where you will be given a preliminary physical examination. Then you sign up your formal enlistment papers in the Civilian Conservation Corps. You sign up for a period of six months at $30.00 per month. Of this $30.00, if you have any dependents you agree to allot them from $22.00 to $25.00 per month. This will leave you $5.00 to $8.00 a month for spending money, which according to authorities will be ample because everything in the way of necessities will be furnished gratis.</p>

<p>After signing up you will be given an order for transportation to training camp. When you report to the training camp you will spend two weeks being "conditioned" which means that you will be conditioned physically for the outdoor life you will lead for the next six months and will be taught the routine of camp life. </p>

<p>If you need clothing, anything from underwear to a hat or shoes will be supplied to you free of charge. It will be regular army work clothing supplied you from the quartermaster's stores.</p>

<p>During the training period you and your companions will be organized into companies. Instead of a captain, however, you will have a foreman. You will have your own camp clerks and cooks.</p>

<p>When the conditioning period is completed you will be sent to the work camps for work in the forest. There is no assurance that you will be sent to the work camps in South Dakota. You may be sent to any state in the union.</p>

<p>Food, medical attention and work supplies will be furnished free. You will work according to present plans 40 hours a week, the equivalenot <sic>equivalent</sic> of five 8 hour days. If you desire, it is presumed that you will be permitted to re-enlist at the expiration of your six months period. If you do not care to do so, you will be given free transportation to your home.</p>

<p>There is no assurance given as to when the first call for men from South Dakota will be received but it will be in the near future.</p>

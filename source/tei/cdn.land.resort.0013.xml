<p>E.A. Fry, founder of the Lake Andes Wave was in town over Sunday
visiting at the A. Amundson home and also with old friends. It has
been about four years since Mr. Fry left and to say that he was 
surprised at the growth the town has made during that time would be
putting it mildly. He is now located at Niobrara, Nebraska, and is
writing a history of Knox county. Mr. Fry informed us that the reputation
of our lake as a fishing and hunting resort had spread far and wide and 
that he was going to spend a few days this summer trying his luck 
with members of the finny tribe.</p>

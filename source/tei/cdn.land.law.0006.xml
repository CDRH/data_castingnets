<p>On account of the cold weather and almost completion of the work that can be done without power machinery, the members of the Veterans camp located here the first part of July expect to depart this Thursday night by special train en route for their winter's quarters at Lake View, Ia. There are 236 men in the company in command of Capt. Crigger.</p>

<p>The camp grounds near the Amundson resort will be kept intact and while nothing now is definitely known, it is possible this company or a similar one will return in the spring to complete the spillway for Lake Andes. The task has been a big undertaking and will require much more labor and expense.</p>

<p>Of the 1000 <choice><sic>tile</sic> <corr>tiles</corr></choice> necessary for the work about 470 have been cast. It may be possible that local labor will continue this work as long as weather will permit, the balance to be finished in the spring. The dredging machines now operating will continue the widening and deepening of the ditch.</p>

<p>Capt. Crigger, his <choice><sic>officres</sic> <corr>officers</corr></choice> and men have made many enduring friends during their more than three months stay, who regret to see them depart. Aside from the spillway project they have added much to the beautification of our surroundings, particularly in establishing the first prize camp in competition with those of eleven other states in this corps area, the placing of the name "Lake Andes" on the brow of Monument hill in monster letters and other lesser improvements.</p>

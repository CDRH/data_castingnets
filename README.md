## About Casting Digital Nets

Long ago, glaciers carved out a lake bed that today is known by most as Lake Andes, and Bde Ihanke by Yanktons. Once the center of a post-reservation Indigenous community, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service now manages the lake as a National Wildlife Refuge. This website explores the long, strange journey of the lake - as it moved from a Yankton possession, to a state-supported bass bonanza, to a federal wildlife refuge - with particular attention to land tenure, economic pursuits, and fishery ecology, all unfolding under a backdrop of evolving legal doctrine and international treaties.

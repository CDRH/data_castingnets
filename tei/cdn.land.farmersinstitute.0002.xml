	<head type="main"> WHITE SWAN INDIAN FARMER'S ASSOCIATION MEETING </head>

	<p> Notwithstanding the almost impassable condition of the roads the White Swan Farmer's Association had a good turnout last Thursday.</p>

	<p> The features of the afternoon were talks on farming by Reuben Spottedeagle, Charles LaClair <sic>LeClair</sic> and Isaac Dion, while the "Special" was "Corn" by the noted specialist in that line, Andy Lindquist, who went into the matter of seed corn selection and testing quite extensively. Also the varieties best suited to this locality.</p>

	<p> Mr. Lindquist had an ear of corn with him for which he paid five dollars. He showed the Indian farmers the points of superiority possessed by this ear and told them why it will be worth more than several times five dollars when mixed with several bushels of well selected seed this coming year.</p>

	<p> The place of meeting was changed from the Whitemain dance hall to the police cottage on the government reserve and the time of the next meeting set for Thursday, March 4th. The following programme was arranged for this occassion <sic>occasion</sic>:</p>

	<p> Address&#8212;A. W. Leech, Supt.</p>

<p> Select readings from a farm journal&#8212;Peter Shield.</p>

<p> Stock Raising&#8212;Thomas Hunter.</p>

<p> Breeding and raising hogs&#8212;Huto</p>

<p> Will a grove do any good on a farm?&#8212;John Hopkins</p>

<p> Would it be well for the government to furnish a pedigreed "stock" horse for the Indians' use?&#8212;Ed Vandal.</p>

<p> The members of the association request all Indians and mixed bloods and those of their white neighbors who care to do so, to attend.&#8212;Contributed.</p>

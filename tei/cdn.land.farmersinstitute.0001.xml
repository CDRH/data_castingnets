	<p> The Farmer's Institute and Short Course started Monday, but not on schedule time. The first corps of instructors, who were at Bonesteel, were unable to cross the river at Wheeler, hence had to go around by the way of Yankton, arriving here on the belated freight. However, the evening was taken in a demonstration of candy making. The other speakers arrived on scheduled time and have been having pretty good sized crowds.  The Gunsul building is used for exhibits, the Amundson building for the Home Economics lectures and demonstrations, and the Remington hall for the other speakers.</p>

	<p> The exhibits this year are way ahead of what was expected, some of the classes having better exhibits than last year. The lecturers complimented Lake Andes and vicinity very highly on the display of products, also on the way everything was managed. It is too early at this writing to give a list of the prize winners in the different exhibits, but same will be completed for next week's issue.</p>

	<p> Coming as it has, during Thanksgiving week, has been an exceptionally poor time for the institute as most people were pretty busy preparing for the big day, consequently could not spend as much time at the lectures as they would have liked. At that, we think everyone will agree with us in saying the institute and short course was a decided success from every viewpoint.</p>

	<p> This is the first short course we have had, but it is plain to be seen the short course is far ahead of the two day institute, and we hope this vicinity will be favored with a short <choice><sic>cocrse</sic> <corr>course</corr></choice> for next year, only at a more favorable time of the year.</p>

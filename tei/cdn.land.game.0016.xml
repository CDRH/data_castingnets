<p><choice><sic>Their</sic> <corr>There</corr></choice> was some doings in the game warden line last Saturday when Game Warden Radcliffe arrested several parties for unlawfully catching fish. It seems that the fish were all swimming on the surface of the water, and all you had to do was to pull them out. What the matter was is hard to tell, and many are the opinions expressed, one of which is that the fish were dynamited. Others seem to think that the great quantity of moss that gathered in this end of the lake had something to do with the case. Reports from other parts of the lake say the fish are as game as ever, and at this writing they are also here. </p>

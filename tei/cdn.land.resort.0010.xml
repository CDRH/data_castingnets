<p>J. Beagle, W.B. Bowman, F.E. Cochran and Fred Flint composed a 
fishing party to Lake Andes Saturday returning Monday. The outing
was greatly enjoyed and a nice string of black bass was brought home
as a reward for the long drive over and back. The above party was 
joined at the lake by Harry Dettman and Fred Rogers' who piloted us
to the fishing grounds and joined in fascinating sport. Harry
has secured a good job at Lake Andes with the Queal Lumber Co. and
likes his new home. Fred Rogers will be remembered by many Fairfax
people as being one of the former publishers of the old Sund Review, 
now a resident of Lake Andes. If you want to forget your business
cares for a few days just hie away to the lake and fishing rod and a 
goodly supply of the right brand of bait. &#8212;Fairfax Advertiser.</p>

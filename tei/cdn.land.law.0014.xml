<p>Lieut. E. T. Whiting of Ft. Mead has been supervising the improvements and changes in the barracks, mess hall and sleeping quarters. The officers  <sic>officers'</sic> quarters are to occupy what was formerly the old kitchen. A new kitchen will be added adjoining the mess hall, a modern heating and cooking plant including ranges will be added as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The roofs of the buildings will be repaired and much paint added inside and out. The grounds will be re-arranged and beautified.</p>

<p>The members of the camps are residents of Nebraska and range in age from 18 to 24 years. They will be employed on the completion of the spillway of the lake and other projects the plans of which are not yet completed. It is expected the camp will be operative until late in the fall.</p>

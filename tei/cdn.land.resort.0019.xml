<p>Ye editor took a few days vacation at Lake Andes last week, the guest
of Albert Amundson. We have had an invitation from that gentleman
several times this spring to come down to his town and enjoy a few
days fishing. During the past few years we have enjoyed many fishing
excursions to Lake Andes but on most of our trips the fish were not
in a catchable humor. In any event while we always enjoyed our trips
to the Lake we were seldom able to brag on our prowess as a fisherman;
but on this trip we beat all of our past records, as we caught about
forty fine bass and were able bring home enough to pass around a mess
to many of neighbors to prove that we had become "some fisherman While
we were at the Lake we also enjoyed a fine auto ride out into the
country with Druggist O.C. Nicolls, who now drives a fine 35 horse
power Studebaker auto. The country north and east of Lake Andes
looks beautiful. Large farm buildings, groves, and a variety of crops
in a most thrifty condition greeted the eye on all hands and on this
trip we saw some of the finest fields of alfalfa that we have ever 
seen anywhere. The country around the lake has been favored with
some heavy rains this spring and as a consequence, together with 
good farming, the crops in that locality never looked better at this 
time of year. - Wheeler Courier.</p>

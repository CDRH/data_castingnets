<p>Many inquiries have been received from local men seeking employment as to whether or not they could secure work on the proposed lake improvements.</p>

<p>Should Lake Andes be designated to receive federal aid, we are reliably informed that this work would come under the government Civilian Conservation Corps plan. As such, all labor would be furnished through a corps of men sent here from the army's conditioning camp at Fort Meade.</p>

<p>The side issues, however, resulting from the establishment of such a camp would bring many direct benefits to the community as a whole.</p>

<p>Major K. S. Bradford of Fort Meade and Oscar Johnson, director of game and fish, were in the city Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning looking over possible sites in case a CCC camp was established here to work on the stabilization project of Lake Andes.</p>

<p>Nothing definite will be known until the latter part of the week when these gentlemen return to Pierre from their inspection tour and confer with Gov. Berry and Director Eales.</p>

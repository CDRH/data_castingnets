No. 1776 has received the <unclear reason="illegible"/> award from the Army and Navy <unclear reason="illegible" /> of Washington, D. C. in a <unclear reason="illegible" /> <choice><sic>sponsered</sic> <corr>sponsored</corr></choice> by this publication <unclear reason="illegible" /> the highest scoring camp in the 7th corps area which <choice><sic>incluudes</sic> <corr>includes</corr></choice> 158 camps. From the 8 states, Arkansas, <unclear reason="illegible">Minnesota</unclear>, Kansas, Missouri, North and South Dakota, Nebraska and <unclear reason="illegible" /> Lake Andes, 1776 had the highest rating in the various points re-<unclear reason="illegible" />. The sanitation of the <unclear reason="selection" />, preparing, and serving of the <unclear reason= "illegible">food</unclear>, care of kitchen and mess halls and arrangement of tents from point <unclear reason="illegible" />. <unclear reason="illegible" >Sufficiency</unclear>, bathing facilities and <unclear reason="illegible">health protection</unclear>  also recreational <unclear reason="illegible">stages</unclear> and layout and beautification of ground were all considered <unclear reason="illegible">for the</unclear> final award.

<p> Colonel Pendleton of Omaha was <unclear reason="illegible">the</unclear> inspecting officer and recommended this camp as the highest.</p>

<p> <unclear reason="illegible">The</unclear> local community can best <unclear reason="illegible">speculate</unclear> what the officers and <unclear>men</unclear> have accomplished in the <unclear reason="illegible">weeks</unclear> since the camp site was <unclear reason="illegible">made</unclear> in the alfalfa field east of the <unclear></unclear> park.</p>

<p> <unclear reason="illegible">It is</unclear> now an attractive addition to <unclear reason="illegible">the town</unclear> and the community is justified that such an honor has been <unclear reason="illegible">bestowed</unclear>, possibly realizing more <unclear reason="illegible">than</unclear> others what the camp has accomplished. Each camp had only a <unclear reason="illegible">limited</unclear> amount of money to spend <unclear reason="illegible">and careful</unclear> management together with hard work has placed this camp at the top. The officers and the men are to be congratulated.</p>

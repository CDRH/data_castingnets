<p>Deputy Sheriff J. E. Craig captured three men who were trying to get out of the county by the means
of floating down the river in a skiff. These men were wanted at Oacona on a charge of grand
larceny. They were tough looking characters. The Deputy Sheriff of Lyman county came down and
took charge of them.</p>

<p>Two young men went out in a boat at Lake Andes last Sunday and on being out from the shore
about twenty rods disrobed to take a bath. In some way the boat tipped over and soon went to the
bottom. The cry for help was heard by H. D. James, Esq., of Wagner who was in camp on shore. Mr.
James hastily jumped into his boat and pulled for the two men who were <choice><sic>strugling</sic> <corr>struggling</corr></choice> in the water. He arrived none too soon for the men were in an exhausted condition. On being brought to the
shore these men vowed they would not get "gay" again on the lake. In addition to their clothes
a gold watch and about twenty-five dollars in money and a boat lies in the bottom of the lake
and they themselves had a miraculous escape from drowning.</p>

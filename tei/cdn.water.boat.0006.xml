<p>A. Amundson, former owner of The Wave, has just had a gasoline launch
constructed to suit the requirements of the lake and is putting a deal of 
his spare time to mastering the intricacies of a gas dev-engine. A few boats 
of this character are a much needed improvement on the lake, and while it is 
to be regretted that Mr. Amundson's boat is for private use only, it is hoped 
that it will stimulate others to build as well.The <choice><sic>diminsions</sic> <corr>dimensions</corr></choice> of the launch 
are "length over-all twenty-eight feet, beam six feet, three horse power." Stern 
wheel propeller and full cabined, the sides being removable at will. It is a safe steady 
sea boat and the engine which is small in proportion will send it at a speed of five miles 
an hour with a load of fifteen people. The draught full loaded being fourteen inches.</p>

<p>M. Qualey and T.E. Andrews nixed in a runaway accident
Monday evening. They had started for the lake and had got out a short
distance when Anton Chytka drove up, and asked them if they did not want to ride.
They had not gained far before the team started to run, throwing the occupants of the
buggy out upon the ground. Mr. Andrews received some bruises to one of his legs, but is able to be 
around, but is pretty lame. Mr. Qualey was not so fortunate, he was thrown in such a manner as to fall on
his left arm, badly spraining it, as a result he will have to carry his arm in a sling for 
several weeks. We are glad to say that there were no bones broken.
Mr. Chytka was also bruised up considerable.</p>
